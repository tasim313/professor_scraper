docs(security): add security policy for supported versions and reporting vulnerabilities

Adds a new Security Policy to the project to outline:
- Supported versions of the application for security updates.
- Clear guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities, including contact methods, 
  expected response times, and the investigation process.

This document helps ensure responsible disclosure and enhances 
trust for contributors and users.

Closes #123
